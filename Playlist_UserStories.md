## Jukebox Project

### What is Jukebox?

It is an application which enables the creation of music play lists. Imagine you are hosting a party, and you want to play the songs you love and give people a chance to choose some of the songs. 

**Usage scenarios**

- Party host and invitees have the Jukebox app installed in their smartphones.
- Host creates a party in the app.
- Host defines a play list, which is a sequence of songs and empty spots.
- Host provides a list of songs he/she has.
- When invitee arrives physically in the party location, it will be able to log in the party. Only people in the area can log in the party.
- Invitees can see the songs available, and vote to fill the empty spots.
- Invitees can send messages to people who are locally present.
- Invitees can have the whole song list.


**Application principles**

- Privacy: parties can be located only through a unique party name. Invitees will see the party name, host name. Minimal information will be stored in servers.
- Create mini sites for small events.
- Enable local communication, like chats, and also an electronic "Correio Elegante". The idea is to be an ice-breaker so you can communicate secretly with the boy/girl you like.
- Future: enable "bring your own music", so invitees can stream songs in their devices to the party device.


**Connected ideas**

- Radios still use sms to get song recommendations from people who listen radio, this can evolve to an app enabling music stations to choose songs, an also have a direct contact with users.
 

### Jukebox Objectives

- Be a jukebox for parties (50 people)
- Enable local communication
- Be a "Correio elegante".
